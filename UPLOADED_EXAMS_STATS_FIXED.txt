UPLOADED EXAMS - STATISTICS ISOLATION FIX - COMPLETED
================================================================================
Date: February 9, 2026
Issue: Statistics in Uploaded Exams table not showing isolated stats per exam

================================================================================
WHAT WAS FIXED
================================================================================

BEFORE:
-------
Uploaded Exams table showed:
  - Exam Name
  - Students (count only)
  - Uploaded Date
  - Uploaded By
  - Actions

Problem: No visibility of pass/fail stats, unclear if stats are isolated.

AFTER:
------
Uploaded Exams table now shows:
  - Exam Name
  - Students (total)
  - Pass (green, bold)
  - Fail (red, bold)
  - Pass % (color-coded badge)
  - Uploaded Date
  - Uploaded By
  - Actions

Solution: Clear isolated statistics visible directly in the table!

================================================================================
CURRENT STATUS - VERIFIED WORKING
================================================================================

December 2025 Exam:
  Students: 4 | Pass: 4 | Fail: 0 | Pass Rate: 100.0% (GREEN)

January 2026 Exam:
  Students: 1 | Pass: 1 | Fail: 0 | Pass Rate: 100.0% (GREEN)

CONFIRMED: Each exam shows ONLY its own statistics - fully isolated!

================================================================================
